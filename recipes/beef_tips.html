    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Technically, beef tips come from the tip cut of the tenderloin. However, many people use "beef tips" to refer to a dish that consists of cubed meat simmered slowly in a savory gravy until it's tender. Cubed stew meat is used in this recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul type="square">
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
        <li>3 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (.75 ounce) packet dry brown gravy mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 2 cups water, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce into the skillet. Stir in garlic powder, salt, and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add onion and saute until almost translucent, about 3 minutes. Add stew meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides; about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the meat is almost finished, mix remaining 1 cup water and gravy mix until thoroughly combined; stir into the meat mixture and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened.</li>
    </ol>
